# Why we code: public talk and weekend workshop

## Who

Anyone from student to senior scholar is welcome to join us, especially if any of these describe you:

- interested in or sceptical about how coding can provoke thinking about language and literature
- no programming background, but would like the chance to get hands-on experience in the context of humanities studies
- have some previous programming experience, but curious about Julia
- coming from outside the humanities and wonder why my friends and colleagues who study humanities would write code


## What

- Public talk followed by discussion (Thursday, April 7: poster below)

Overviews of workshop sessions (all sessions held in Furman Hall 117):

- some [basics for humanities research](./session1/) (Saturday, April 9, 9:30-11:30)
