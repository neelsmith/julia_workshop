# Technical prerequisites

There are only two prerequisites for this workshop:

1. the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/downloads/).  Download and install the current stable release.
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Download and install the current version for your OS. 



## Testing your Julia installation

![](./julia-icon.png) Find an icon that your Julia installation created that looks similar to this, and use it to open an interactive Julia terminal (or REPL).  If you  see a prompt like this one, you're running Julia!

Exit the REPL by typing `exit()` (followed by return).


## Configuring and testing your VS Code installation

Open Visual Studio Code.

On the left side of the window, you'll see a strip of icons. Click on the highlighted icon that looks like a block being fit into a grid. This lets you add extensions to VS Code.

If you're on Mac OS, open VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and start typing 'shell command'.  When you see a listing like this !()[https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/setup/mac/shell-command.png], choose `Install 'code' command in PATH`.
