# Session 1: basics for humanities research 
{: .no_toc }


## Overview 
{: .no_toc }

In our first session, we'll introduce some essential ideas for computational study in the humanities.  Working in the Julia REPL (Julia's interactive Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), we'll organize different types of information in collections that we can query and transform.

## Coding concepts in this session

- Julia's nouns: objects, values, types, and variables
- Julia's verbs: functions for working with objects
- Collections of objects
- Filtering and mapping collections

## Review materials

Although we'll work in the Julia REPL in our workshop, you can use this Pluto notebook to review, or to experiment with some self-correcting examples:
