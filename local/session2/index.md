# Session 2: Lincoln's Gettysburg Address

## Overview


What distinguishes the style of a literary work?  In this session, we'll continue to work  in the Julia REPL, but will also run short scripts in Visual Studio Code to identify and graphically visualize features of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address that we can compare with other famous political orations delivered in times of war.

## Coding concepts in this session

- using tuples to group objects together
- sorting a list of tuples
- using PlotlyJS to visualize data



## Review materials

Although weâ€™ll work in Visual Studio Code in this session of our workshop, you can use this Pluto notebook to review, or to experiment with some self-correcting examples:
