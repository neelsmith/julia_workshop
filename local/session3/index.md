# Session 3: comparing translations of the Bible



## Overview

In our third workshop session, we will work primarily in Julia's new Pluto notebooks to explore patterns of language in different openly licensed translations of the Bible in multiple languages.  We will build an interactive tool for visualizing *n-grams* (sequences of `n` successive terms) in a text.  Questions we will address include:  how do n-grams reflect the structure and syntax of different languages? How do n-grams point us towards patterns in the translation of concepts in the source text?  Can we identify common features across languages?
