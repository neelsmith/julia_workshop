We'll continue to work in the Julia REPL throughout the first session of our workshop. Use this  Pluto notebook to review, or to experiment with some self-correcting examples.

Let's review the function we wrote in [the notebook for session 1a](https://neelsmith.github.io/why_we_code/notebooks/session1/session1anb.html).  Recall that we provide one string parameter, and get back an alphabetized list of words.

md"""
Creating an alphabetized wordlist for a text is a useful scholarly function that is *not* built in to the Julia language.  Even the short example we just wrote should be prompting some questions.  Should we distinguish upper and lower case?  Should we include punctuation characters like the period in `sleep.` in the above example?  We'll consider some of these questions in session 2.  In this notebook, we'll learn more about working with collections of data.

### Downloading from the internet

Before we do, let's see how to download content from the internet so that we aren't limited to what we can type at the keyboard! We'll use the `Downloads` package that is part of the Julia language but not loaded by default until you include it with the `using` keyword.

"""

You can use the function `Downloads.download` with one parameter: a URL to download.

Let's get an early look at the text of the Gettysburg Address that our next session will focus on.

Note that we have easily strung three basic functions together and gone from a URL to a String value with the contents of the remote file.  That's great -- but again, a common enough task for us that we may as well encapsulate the idea of reading String data from a URL in a new function of our own.  The following creates a function named `string_dl` (for "string download").

We might like to know how many any items are in our collection.  The `length` function that you have already encountered works with any kind of list.  (That's actually why it works with strings:  under the hood, a String is just a list of characters!) 
"""

You can refer to individual items in a list using a numeric index value between square brackets.  The next cell, for example, first the alphabetically first word in the text:
"""

md"""### Testing conditions

One question we'll consider in our next session is whether word length helps us define stylistic habits.  In simplest terms: does an author use big words?

We answer that question for a particular word by asking if a word is longer than some threshhold or cutoff point.  In Julia, we can express that with the `>` function.

"""

# ╔═╡ ea8ab664-2fe2-4cdf-a1d9-6d8d77fe7c61
threshhold = 9

# ╔═╡ 31943c2b-ae63-4a9c-8387-52a21dba2414
md"""Recall that `vocablist[1]` is `"But"` -- way shorter than 9 characters!

But again the parentheses may make this function awkward to read.  Let's take advantage of another Julia formatting option:  when a function has *two* parameters, say 'A' and 'B', we can invoke as `A function B`.  This is exactly equivalent to `function(A,B)`, as you can see in the more readable following cell:
"""

"""

# ╔═╡ 44e45c95-2dbb-4086-8326-4df802bf06b3
md"""### `for` loops

It's common to process every item in a collection.  In the second half of this notebook, we'll look at two important functions, `filter` and `map`, that work on entire collections, but there are times when you will want to process each item in  a collection.  Julia meets this need with the `for` loop. The general form is

```
for VARIABLE_NAME in COLLECTION
	EXPRESSION
end
```

The `for` loop cycles through every item in your collection, and assigns it to the variable name you supply.  Let's see how we can use a `for` to find the *longest* word in our vocabulary list from the Gettysburg Address.

"""

# ╔═╡ 535de6fb-d0df-4ca9-8565-f149657cf8f1
md"""
We'll define a function called `longest` that will look at every item in a list and return the length of longest term in the lexicon.   

We'll start by creating two variables:  `maxlength` records the length of the longest word we have encountered;  to start with, it will be `0`;  `longestseen` is the longest string we have seen so far; to start with, it will be the empty string `""`.  We can then use a `for` loop to consider every word in the list successively.  If it is longer than the longest seen so far, we will assign the word to our `longestseen` variable, record its length in the variable `maxlength`.

Finally, we'll remember to put the answer to our question, "What is the longest word in the list?" on the last line of our function so that will be returned as the value of the function.
"""
